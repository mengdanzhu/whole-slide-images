# Whole Slide Images
Pre-Processing Scripts
======================
See code/z_preprocessing for some code to convert images from svs into jpg. This uses OpenSlide and takes a while. How much you want to compress images will depend on the resolution that they were originally scanned, but a guideline that has worked for us is 3-5 MB per WSI.
